# Application of Software Engineering principles to interface Myokit and PINTS packages

Hi fellow scientist !

It's a pleasure to greet you to our repo. 

We propose hereby a Python package that enables an easy fitting of model parameters, making the connection between the Myokit package (http://myokit.org/) useful for its simple way of writing ODE models, and PINTS (https://github.com/pints-team/pints) useful for its amazing library of fitting possibilities and MCMC samplers. This project was initiated during Software Engineering classes at University of Oxford, in the SABS Doctoral Training Center (https://www.sabsr3.ox.ac.uk/). 

To ensure you have a smooth experience using our Python package, we wrote some examples just for you. You might want to check that out, in the Examples folder. 

We hope that you will enjoy using the present tool, and that it brightens up your day of programming :)

If you are using our software for any of your paper, we would be thankful for citing in using the BibTeX reference below. Please note that both authors contributed equally to this work.

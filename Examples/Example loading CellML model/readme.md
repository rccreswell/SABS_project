## Getting the CellML model to your machine

If you are brave enough, you can start writing the CellML model from scratch on your own. This is a whole journey, for which you will need to get to know how to write CellML code (have a look at CellmL tutorials: https://www.cellml.org/getting-started/tutorials). Otherwise, you can also download the published models in the CellML format directly, from the repo: https://models.physiomeproject.org/cellml. You just need to browse to the desired model and download it to your machine.

## Loading the CellML model with the package

Here, we will use the example of Grandi, Pasqualini, Bers 2010 model for cardiac cells (https://models.physiomeproject.org/workspace/grandi_pasqualini_bers_2010/file/8a2c891da5f2f1b90d9c465b7bc63f652999d096/grandi_pasqualini_bers_2010.cellml).
